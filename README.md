# Linear Programming and Integer Programming Solver

A .NET 9 application that solves Linear Programming (LP) and Integer Programming (IP) models, including the Knapsack problem. This project was developed as part of the LPR 381 (Linear Programming) course, focusing on implementing core optimization algorithms with an emphasis on educational value and code clarity.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Last line: Variable types (+, -, urs, int, bin) for each variable

## Usage

```bash
LinearProgrammingApp.exe <inputfile>
```

The program will prompt you to choose between:
1. Primal Simplex Algorithm
2. Revised Primal Simplex Algorithm

## üöß In Progress / To Be Implemented

### Branch and Bound Implementation (In Progress)
- **Basic Structure** - Initial implementation started
- **Node Management** - Basic node creation and management
- **Branching** - Basic variable selection and branching
- **Bound Calculation** - Basic bound calculation
- **Pruning** - Basic pruning of suboptimal branches

### Future Enhancements
- **Cutting Plane Algorithm** - For integer programming problems
- **Knapsack Solver** - Specialized branch and bound for knapsack problems

### Potential Future Features
- **Enhanced Output** - Better formatting and display of solutions
- **File I/O** - Export/import of problems and solutions

## Current Status

**Core Functionality (80%)** - The application can solve standard linear programming problems using both primal and revised simplex methods. The basic structure for branch and bound is in place but requires further development.

**Known Limitations**
- Branch and bound implementation is incomplete
- Limited error handling and input validation
- Basic output formatting
- No sensitivity analysis
