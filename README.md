# Linear Programming and Integer Programming Solver

A .NET 9 application that solves Linear Programming (LP) and basic Integer Programming (IP) models. This project was developed as part of the LPR 381 (Linear Programming) course, focusing on implementing core optimization algorithms with an emphasis on educational value and code clarity.

## Project Overview

This Visual Studio project implements various optimization algorithms for solving linear programming and integer programming problems. The application accepts mathematical models via input text files and exports detailed results to output files.

## Architecture

The solution consists of four main projects:

- **LinearProgrammingApp** - Console application and main entry point
- **LinearProgramming.Parsing** - Input file parsing and model representation
- **LinearProgramming.Algorithms** - Implementation of optimization algorithms
- **LinearProgramming.Tests** - Unit tests for validation

## âœ… Implemented Features

## Input File Format

The application accepts input files in the following format:

```
max +2 +3 +3 +5 +2 +4
+11 +8 +6 +14 +10 +10 <= +40
bin bin bin bin bin bin
```

**Format Specification:**
- Line 1: `max/min` followed by objective coefficients with +/- operators
- Lines 2-n: Constraint coefficients, operator (<=, >=, =), and RHS value
- Last line: Variable types (+, -, urs, int, bin) for each variable

## Usage

```bash
LinearProgrammingApp.exe <inputfile>
```

The program will prompt you to choose between:
1. Primal Simplex Algorithm
2. Revised Primal Simplex Algorithm

## Current Status

**Core Functionality (80%)** - The application can solve standard linear programming problems using both primal and revised simplex methods. The basic structure for branch and bound is in place but requires further development.

**Known Limitations**
- Branch and bound implementation is incomplete
- Limited error handling and input validation
- Basic output formatting
- No sensitivity analysis

## Technical Requirements

- **.NET 9.0** - Latest .NET framework
- **Visual Studio 2022** - Recommended IDE
- **MathNet.Numerics** - Mathematical operations library
- **XUnit** - Testing framework

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run with input file

```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test
```
